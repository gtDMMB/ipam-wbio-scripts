## 5S rRNA - Escherichia Coli

The clustering at threshold 97 does not recapitulate the profiling results since 
the selected profiles are not separated into distinct clusters. Nevertheless, 
clustering may improve on profiling. One reason is that the 11 clusters 
containing the 13 selected profiles cover 83.5% of the sample, while the 
coverage by selected profiles is 70.4%. In addition, clustering reveals that the 
overlapping features 5 and 24 may coexist, though they do not appear together in 
any selected profile.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1234. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 97% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
