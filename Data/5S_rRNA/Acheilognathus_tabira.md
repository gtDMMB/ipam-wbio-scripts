## 5S rRNA - Acheilognathus Tabira

The clustering at threshold 94 recapitulates the profiling results because it 
contains a cluster for each selected/intersection profile; the mass of these 
clusters equals the specific frequency of the corresponding profile. The only 
exception is given by the selected profile [0[9[38[21[176]][28[17]]]][5]] and 
the intersection profile [0[9[38[21][28[17]]]][5]] that are stored together in 
a cluster whose mass is the sum of their specific frequencies. Clustering 
improves on profiling because it provides additional information on the ensemble. 
For example, it emerges that structures represented by the selected profile 
[0[28[17]]] also share helix class 80 = (23, 94, 3), which was not a feature in 
profiling. Moreover, clustering highlights overlapping helix classes (other than 
34 and 176) that do not coexist in the sampled structures. For instance, 5 and 
80, as well as 5 and 4 = (66, 109, 7).

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1234. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 94% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
