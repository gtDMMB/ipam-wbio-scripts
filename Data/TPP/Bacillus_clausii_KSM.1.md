## TPP - Bacillus Clausii

The clustering results at the edge sparsification threshold $87$ does not 
recapitulate profiling: though it contains all the selected profiles but 
groups them into the $2$ largest clusters ([5[6[4][3]][19[7]]], 
[5[11[4][3]][19[7]]], and [5[11[4][3]][19[7]]][138] in one and 
[5[11[4][3]][56[7]]] and [5[11[4][3]][56[393[7]]]] in another). Clustering 
improves on profiling, as the 2 largest clusters containing the 5 selected 
profiles cover 95.9% of the sample, while the coverage by selected profiles 
is 78.3%. The close observation reveals that features 6 and 11 (19 and 
56, respectively) may coexist, though they do not appear together in any 
selected profile.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 87% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
