## THF - Clostridium Botulinu

Profiling identifies five selected profiles which cover 76% of the sample. 
Clustering at the threshold 96% recapitulates the profiling result. The five 
selected profiles belong to the largest five clusters, respectively. Coverage 
by these five clusters is the same as the coverage by the five selected 
profiles. Clustering does not improve on profiling. Although clustering 
identifies additional 40 clusters, the size of each cluster is smaller than 38.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1234. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 96% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
