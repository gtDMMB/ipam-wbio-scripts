## Qrr1 - Vibrionaceae Harveyi

In this case, the two selected profiles cover only 70.1\% of the sample. 
Clustering does not recapitulate this result, as it combines the two selected 
profiles into one cluster, and it also produces an additional cluster 
containing profiles without helix class 13. We deem the clustering result an 
improvement over profiling. First, clustering recovers the portion of the 
sample without helix class 13, which is lost in profiling. Second, in the 
cluster that combines the two selected profiles, over half of the extended 
profiles without helix class 46 contain alternative helix classes that cover 
the same general region of base pairs. It is therefore more informative to 
consider these two profiles in one group due to the similarity of their base 
pair structures.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 53% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
