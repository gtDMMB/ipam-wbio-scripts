## THF - Streptococcus Uberis

Profiling identifies five selected profiles which cover 60.5% of the sample. At 
the threshold 99%, clustering recapitulates the profiling result because the 
five selected profiles belong to the largest five clusters. Coverage by these 
five clusters is the same as the coverage by the five selected profiles. 
Clustering does not improve on profiling. The additional 80 clusters identified 
by clustering have a size smaller than 30.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1234. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 99% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
