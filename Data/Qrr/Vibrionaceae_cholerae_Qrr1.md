## Qrr1 - Vibrionaceae Cholerae

The clustering pipeline does not recapitulate the profiling result, as the 
clustering formed at the maximal CH-index criteria (48\% edge threshold) 
combines selected profiles [2][7[3]][0] and [2][92][7[3]][0] into one cluster. 
It would be reasonable to combine these profiles into one cluster if extended 
profiles corresponding to profile [2][7[3]][0] contained non-featured helix 
classes with base pairings in the same general region as helix class 92. 
However, this was not the case when we observed the extended profiles from 
clustering. Since these two selected profiles occur with high frequency in the 
sample and are distinct from one another at the level of the base pairings, we 
judge that these two profiles should not be combined into one cluster, and the 
clustering result does not improve upon profiling.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 48% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
