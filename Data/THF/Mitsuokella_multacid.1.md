Profiling identifies nine selected profiles which cover 62.8% of the sample. 
Clustering at the threshold 97% does not recapitulate the profiling result. 
The reason is that clustering groups the selected profiles 
[6[26[24[10[139[204]]][12]]]] and [6[26[24[156[10[139[204]]][12]]]]] in one 
cluster. It also groups the selected profiles [6[26[24[10[139[204]]][115[12]]]]] 
and [6[26[24[156[10[139[204]]][115[12]]]]]]. Clustering may improve on profiling. 
It recovers another cluster that contains feature 205. Meanwhile, the 9 selected 
profiles are distributed in 7 clusters. Taking into account the cluster 
containing feature 205, we notice that the coverage by the 8 clusters is 72.4%. 
It is higher than the 62.8% coverage by the 9 selected profiles.

This clustering was generated using an ensemble from RNAstructure with seed 1234. 
It used the frequency distance metric between extended profiles and removed the 
lowest 97% of edges. GMC was used for clustering.
